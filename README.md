## Markdown
This Document is written in Markdown and it's a super important language and tool to use in programming, so I want to start with Markdown. 

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. The philosophy behind Markdown is that plain text documents should be readable without tags mussing everything up, but there should still be ways to add text modifiers like lists, bold, italics, etc. It is an alternative to WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors, which use rich text that later gets converted to proper HTML.

Here are some resources for more info on Markdown, including what is it, why important and how to use it:
