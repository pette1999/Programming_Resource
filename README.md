## Markdown
This Document is written in Markdown and it's a super important language and tool to use in programming, so I want to start with Markdown. 

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. The philosophy behind Markdown is that plain text documents should be readable without tags mussing everything up, but there should still be ways to add text modifiers like lists, bold, italics, etc. It is an alternative to WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors, which use rich text that later gets converted to proper HTML.

Here are some resources for more info on Markdown, including what is it, why important and how to use it:

## Python
As the saying goes, the master teaches the trade, but apprenticers skill is self-made.With Python's popularity, more and more people want to learn Python, and want to learn it systematically. Here we will share the experience of several free learning materials on :octocat:Github for students to learn.

* [:octocat: Learn-python3](https://github.com/jerry-git/learn-python3) - :star2: 4.5K - :fork_and_knife: 1.3K 
  <details>
    <summary>Resources for learning and teaching beginner to intermediate-level Python 3.</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>The contents of this repo are very well structured and in Jupyter Notebooks.</li>
      <li>The beginner folder inside the notebooks folder contains 19 introductory topics such as strings, conditionals, classes, exceptions, and so, to get you started. We recommend taking a look at the repo for the full list.</li>
      <li>The rest of the advanced topics are provided in the intermediate folder, such as writing idiomatic Python, a few other general topics, and some best practices to help you avoid writing disastrous and inefficient code.</li>
    </ul>

* [:octocat: Learn-python](https://github.com/trekhleb/learn-python)  - :star2: 11.7K - :fork_and_knife: 1.9K 
  <details>
    <summary>Similar to learn-python3, learn-python repository also serves as a handy collection of Python resources for beginners and intermediate learners.</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>The repository uses a collection of Python scripts to cover individual topics in Python, such as operators, data types, classes, modules, and much more, with precise explanations and accompanying examples.</li>
      <li>There’s also a small section explaining how to use this repository to help you make the most out of this repo. </li>
      <li>Oleksii calls the repo a playground and a cheat sheet as during the learning phase, learners will often return to the repo to experiment with the code examples for a closer hands-on feel. Once you feel comfortable writing your own Python code, you can use the mentioned linting tools, like pylint, to clean the code while the necessary testing is handled by pytest.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
* [:octocat: Awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python)  - :star2: 113K - :fork_and_knife: 20.5K 
  <details>
    <summary>A thoughtful yet enormous collection of Python frameworks, libraries, tools, and other handy resources.</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>The repo has listed over 90 different categories for individual projects or topics including admin panels, data validations, computer vision, algorithms and design patterns, ChatOps tools, and so much more.</li>
      <li>Provides links to useful books, newsletters, podcasts, and web series dedicated to making Python easier for everyone.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
* [:octocat: Project-Based Learning](https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning#python)  - :star2: 61.3K - :fork_and_knife: 9.3K 
  <details>
    <summary>Packed with tutorials for various programming languages with a specific focus on being project-oriented.</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>A huge list of over 20 programming languages, we’ll be focussing only on Python for this write-up but feel free to check the projects from other programming languages.</li>
      <li>Includes tons of tutorials for building a host of projects from web scrapers, bots, and web applications to building Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning solutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
* [:octocat: Python-programming-exercises](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises)  - :star2: 18.3K - :fork_and_knife: 6.1K 
  <details>
    <summary>Has more than 100 Python programming challenges that cater to new developers, intermediate developers, as well as veteran professionals.</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Jeffrey also has a website that teaches you foundational Python in the form of comics, which you can also use, but unless you know Chinese, you would be hard-pressed to understand it.</li>
      <li>It comes with the required hints and the solution, but try not to scroll too far down, or else you’ll stumble upon the answer.</li>
    </ul>
