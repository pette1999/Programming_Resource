## Markdown
This Document is written in Markdown and it's a super important language and tool to use in programming, so I want to start with Markdown. 

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. The philosophy behind Markdown is that plain text documents should be readable without tags mussing everything up, but there should still be ways to add text modifiers like lists, bold, italics, etc. It is an alternative to WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors, which use rich text that later gets converted to proper HTML.

Here are some resources for more info on Markdown, including what is it, why important and how to use it:

### CSS_Animation_Guide
CSS animations are a relatively simple way to add polish and delight to your web apps. Animation is becoming increasingly common as a way to signify that elements are interactive, and they can also be used to create games or interactive experiences. Through this guide we'll learn some of the tools we can use to add animations to our site. While following along with the material, I encourage you to tinker with real code in the animation sandbox. 

**→ Sandbox Code:** [https://codesandbox.io/s/suspicious-matan-342yy?file=/index.html]

#### Hover States
It's common to add an animation when a user hovers over an interactive element like a button or link. You can do this by using the `:hover` pseudo selector. 

```html
	.box {
	  color: blue;
	}

	.box:hover {
	  /* Change the box color when mouse hovers over element */
	  color: red;
	}
```

##### Hover Flicker
If you're animating any `transform` properties (as we'll do below) you can sometimes see what's called a hover "death flicker" because the element transforms out from under the mouse area, stopping the hover animation. You can fix this by wrapping the element you want to transform in a containing element and using that containing element to detect hover, while still applying the styles to the child element. 

```html
.wrapper:hover .box {
  /* 
			Transform box only when wrapper is hovered,
			so hover area won't rotate out from under the mouse 
  */
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}

/* HTML for this approach */
<div class="wrapper">
	<div class="box"></div>
</div>
```

#### CSS Transforms
Allow you to reposition elements without triggering a re-render. Values are relative to the elements original expected position and do not affect the layout or other elements. Most commonly used values are `translate(xValue, yValue)` `scale()` and `rotate()`

```html
.box { 
  transform: translate(10px) rotate(20deg) scale(1.5);
}
```

#### Transition 
Changing something on hover is great, but it's not really animated if it's instantaneous. We want our property to gradually change into the desired new value, like things do in nature, not just teleport there. CSS handles this automatically with the `transition` property. 

***A note about performance**: Transition works best with properties like `transform` and `opacity` and these values should be used whenever possible. Other properties that affect layout like width, padding, etc will cause multiple re-renders of the element and could result in a laggy performance. 

It requires two values: the property (or properties) to transition, and the duration of the transition. 

The transition property added on the hover state controls the beginning transition, or the transition from the default value to the hover value. The transition property on the normal element controls the exit transition, or the transition from the hover state back to the default.

Many times you'll want these two transitions to be different when implementing action driven animation. [This is a great blog post to learn more about motion design](https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/meaningful-motion-w-action-driven-animation/). 

```html
.box {
  /* hover -> default */
  transition: transform 400ms;
}

.wrapper:hover .box {
  /* default -> hover */
  transition: transform 200ms;
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}
```

##### Transition Timing Functions
The default transition timing function is `ease` . This controls the rate at which the change from one value to the next occurs. You can specify a different timing function in the short-hand for transition.

```html
.wrapper:hover .box {
  transition: transform 200ms ease-in;
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}
```

Play around with the other timing functions `linear` `ease-in` `ease-out` and `ease-in-out`
You can also define your own timing function with `cubic-bezier()` which is often used to create spring-like animations. This is outside of the scope of this class but you can learn more in [this blog post about CSS Bezier Functions](https://css-tricks.com/advanced-css-animation-using-cubic-bezier/). 

#### Custom Keyframe Animations
Sometimes you want a multi-step animation or for something to happen on the page load or with a dynamically added class name in React. For that you can define your own animations with CSS `@keyframes`.

This allows you to define a series of steps, give them a name, and then apply that animation wherever you want in your CSS. The following code creates a custom animation called `fade-in` that starts with an elements opacity at 0 and ends with an element's opacity at 1. 

```html
@keyframes fade-in {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

Try adding as many steps at different % times and as many other animated properties as you want. 

You can apply this animation to an element with the `animation` property. Again, it requires the name of our keyframe animation and a duration.

```html
.box {
  animation: fade-in 100ms;
}
```

#### Animation Delay
You can specify the amount of time you want an animation to wait before running.

```html
.box {
  animation: fade-in 100ms;
  /* Wait 2 seconds before triggering the animation */
  animation-delay: 2s; 
}
```

(You can do the same thing on transitions with `transition-delay` )

#### Animation Fill Modes
When there's a delay on an animation, most of the time you want the animation to be in it's  starting state until the animation, then remain in its ending state. For some weird asf reason, this is not the default behavior. You can change this by using `animation-fill-mode` which [has a lot of different values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-fill-mode), but `both` is the most commonly used one that preserves the starting and ending visual state. 

```html
/* Slap this on whenever you use an animation */
animation-fill-mode: both;
```

### Set_Up_Your_Web_Development_Environment
#### Software Pre-Requisites
1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)	(text editor like Atom, with terminal built in)
2. Create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
3. Create a [Netlify Account](https://www.netlify.com/)	(this is a free, automated CI/CD deploy and hosting platform - it’s phenomenal)
4. Create a [CodeSandbox Account](https://codesandbox.io/)	(It is a browser based Javascript/HTML/CSS development environment)
5. Download and Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)	(a javascript framework for backend code, comes with package manager `npm` CLI utility)

If creating a **static site**, just create a new directory and an HTML and CSS file. 

```bash
mkdir PROJECT_NAME
touch index.html
touch styles.css
```

I'd recommend using Josh Comeau's [HTML Starter Template](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/snippets/html/html-skeleton/) and [CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/#introduction). Just copy and paste from the links into your newly made `index.html` and `styles.css` respectively.

If creating an application, set up your project with NextJS boilerplate. 

```bash
// with styled-components
npx create-next-app --example with-styled-components NAME_OF_PROJECT

// with tailwindcss
npx create-next-app -e with-tailwindcss NAME_OF_PROJECT

// just plain ol' nextjs
npx create-next-app NAME_OF_PROJECT
```

Follow documentation on getting set up with [a plain NextJS app](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) and with an [app with TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs). 

Then change into your project directory and start your server

```bash
cd ./NAME_OF_PROJECT
npm run dev
```

### Set_Up_Your_Supabase_Backend
To add a backend to our application, we will be using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). This is an open source alternative to Google's firebase that provides a lot of backend features out of the box for free. In this application, we will be using their database and authentication. 

Take a deep breath, this might seem overwhelming at first. It will all be ok! 🙏

#### Environment Variables
You'll need to store two environment variables for reference in your project, your supabase url and your anon key. Both of these are designed to be public, so it's ok that they'll appear in your client. Adding row level security to our table (more on this below) will prevent people from  accessing restricted data.

1. Find the url & keys inside your Supabase Settings > API
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project directory and add these two variables. 
```javascript
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://SOME_URL.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=SOME_STRING_OF_CHARS
```
3. Go to your Netlify project > Deployment > Deploy Settings and add the above variables as deployment environment variables as well. Make sure the names match. 

Now both your local and production environments should be able to access these variables and use them to make requests to Supabase.

#### Supabase Client Object
Our front-end needs to authenticate to Supabase to make any API calls. To do this, we will create a utility supabase client object that we can then import into any components that need to make API calls. 
We'll create a new directory called `utils` and put a new` supabaseClient.js` file in it to store our client object.

```javascript
// utils/supabaseClient.js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey)
```

This takes the environment variables we set up earlier and injects them into our client code so that we can use the object `subabase` to make API requests to our backend. You can now import it into any component that needs it. 

```javascript
import { supabase } from '../utils/supabaseClient'

// fetch data function example
const fetchDataFromSupabase = async () => {
    let { data, error } = await supabase
        .from('TABLE_NAME')
        .select('COLUMN, ANOTHER_COLUMN')
    if (error) setError(error.message)
    else {
        setData(data)
        setLoading(false)
    }
  }
```

The above data fetching code could be run on the client, or in `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` depending on the use case. Since we will have row level security (more on this below) and want to limit the data that people can see, we need to run it on the client so it only runs after a user is authenticated (again, more on this below).
