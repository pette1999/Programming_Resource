## Markdown
This Document is written in Markdown and it's a super important language and tool to use in programming, so I want to start with Markdown. 

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. The philosophy behind Markdown is that plain text documents should be readable without tags mussing everything up, but there should still be ways to add text modifiers like lists, bold, italics, etc. It is an alternative to WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors, which use rich text that later gets converted to proper HTML.

Here are some resources for more info on Markdown, including what is it, why important and how to use it:

## Python
As the saying goes, the master teaches the trade, but apprenticers skill is self-made.With Python's popularity, more and more people want to learn Python, and want to learn it systematically. Here we will share the experience of several free learning materials on :octocat:Github for students to learn.

* [:octocat: Learn-python3](https://github.com/jerry-git/learn-python3) - :star2: 4.5K - :fork_and_knife: 1.3K 
  <details>
    <summary>Resources for learning and teaching beginner to intermediate-level Python 3.</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>The contents of this repo are very well structured and in Jupyter Notebooks.</li>
      <li>The beginner folder inside the notebooks folder contains 19 introductory topics such as strings, conditionals, classes, exceptions, and so, to get you started. We recommend taking a look at the repo for the full list.</li>
      <li>The rest of the advanced topics are provided in the intermediate folder, such as writing idiomatic Python, a few other general topics, and some best practices to help you avoid writing disastrous and inefficient code.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
* [:octocat: Learn-python](https://github.com/trekhleb/learn-python)  - :star2: 11.7K - :fork_and_knife: 1.9K

      <li>There’s also a small section explaining how to use this repository to help you make the most out of this repo. </li>
      <li>Oleksii calls the repo a playground and a cheat sheet as during the learning phase, learners will often return to the repo to experiment with the code examples for a closer hands-on feel. Once you feel comfortable writing your own Python code, you can use the mentioned linting tools, like pylint, to clean the code while the necessary testing is handled by pytest.</li>
    </ul>

### CSS_Animation_Guide
CSS animations are a relatively simple way to add polish and delight to your web apps. Animation is becoming increasingly common as a way to signify that elements are interactive, and they can also be used to create games or interactive experiences. Through this guide we'll learn some of the tools we can use to add animations to our site. While following along with the material, I encourage you to tinker with real code in the animation sandbox.
